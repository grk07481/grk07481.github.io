<td><h3><b>Kitty Supremacy</b></h3>
<p>Cats are magical and mystical creatures. They are loyal and perfect in every
way. They are tidy and appreciate cleanliness. My cat's name is Jeff. Jeff
is named after my landlord, Jeff. My landlord Jeff made the process of me
adopting Jeff as an ESA very smooth. I am eternally grateful because
I gave my cat Jeff a nice home. Now he is my apartment's cult leader.
Jeff may be a solid 30 pounds, but boy is he agile. When I adopted him, the 
staff at the humane society informed me that he was the only cat to ever
sneak into the ceiling through a tiny hole that seemed way too small
for him to fit through. This confirms my theory that my cat is indeed a 
shapeshifter.

Once upon a time there was a cat named Jeff. Jeff built a city as tall as the eiffel tower
where all the cats could live. It was there he became a magic professor that taught 
student kitties how to shape shift. It was a hogwarts school for witches and wizards, 
but for cats. He won best shapeshifter and professor of the year. He also 
donated to several charities with his time as an educator.   </p>
<p> <em>SHAPESHIFTERS ARE REAL</em>
<p> MY CAT IS LIVING PROOF. </p>
On this page you will see two picture examples of my cat shapeshifting. I'll
have you decide which is which.
One is my cat shifting into a vampire and the other is him shifting into 
a mermaid.
